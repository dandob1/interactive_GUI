## My Program
**interactive_GUI** is a password-protected calculator application created for the purpose of broadening my understanding of GUIs before they were covered at GW.

## Important
Upon running `EnterPin`, an application will launch requesting a 6-digit PIN. If the code is correctly entered, a calculator application will launch, allowing the user to perform any type of calculations.

The current PIN is set as "202113" and upon successful entry, the calculator will launch. The PIN can be changed at any time in the `addButton` method (comments will be put around where the change can be made).

## How to run the program

1. **Compile and run the project:**
   
   Use the following command:


    - **Windows/Mac:**

        javac EnterPin.java

        and 
        
        java EnterPin
